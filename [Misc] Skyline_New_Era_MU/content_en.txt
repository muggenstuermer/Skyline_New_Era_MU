#Skyline_New_Era_MU



	Skyscrapers now get the 3 existing skinpacks from Vibrant Citys in their full extent.
	For technical reasons, changing the skins of the skyscrapers is only possible as a variation change, shift+V !
	They always follow this pattern in the order:

	- Original building ( no matter what height and composition )
	- "Brick" skin
	- "Nightlife" skin
	- "Colourful" skin

	this applies to all 7 possible skyscraper types, regardless of their height and composition.



	In addition, this mod provides all department stores in high-rise appearance, which initially resemble a construction site.

	- department store
	- furniture store
	- Drugstore


	All stores heights and skins,can be changed via the skin system.

	- Lvl 1 with 1 floor with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
	- Lvl 2 with 2 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
	- Lvl 3 with 3 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
	- Lvl 4 with 4 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful
	- Lvl 5 with 5 floors with possible skins : Original,Brick,Nightlife,Colourful

	Recipes as well as the stores are unlocked like the original.
	
	The area of effect has been lowered from 45 to 25.
	FullSatisfactionDistance and NoSatisfactionDistance have been halved.
	
	
	Wish you much fun with it, muggenstuermer ;)
